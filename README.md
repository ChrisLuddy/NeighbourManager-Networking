# NeighbourManager-Networking
This Python script, a 3rd-year college project, implements a NeighbourManager to manage neighbors and calculate ETX (Expected Transmission Count) metrics in a simulated network. Using multithreading, locks, and timers, it dynamically manages neighbors, probes for updates, selects optimal parents, and logs results. Ideal for IoT and mesh networks.
